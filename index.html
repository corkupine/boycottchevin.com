<p>Chevin Fleet Solutions<br>
881 Main Street<br>
PO Box 2203<br>
Fitchburg, MA 01420</p>

<p>Dear Chevin Fleet Solutions Leadership,</p>

<p>I am writing to express my concern about Chevin Fleet Solutions' contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), totaling $1.6M according to USAspending.gov.</p>

<p>I find it deeply troubling that Chevin states on your website: "We are committed to mitigating the risk of trafficking in persons and forced labour in all aspects of our business," while simultaneously providing services to an agency with documented evidence of trafficking operations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Freedom for Immigrants' report "Trafficked & Tortured" documents ICE using "circular transfers" as a "harsh form of retaliation, torture, and labor trafficking"</li>
<li>Georgetown Law research "Ending Forced Labor in ICE Detention Centers" outlines systematic forced labor risks in immigration detention</li>
<li>ICE's practices meet the legal definition of human trafficking: recruitment/transport + coercion + exploitation</li>
</ul>

<p>This contradiction between your stated anti-trafficking policy and your ICE contracts is indefensible.</p>

<p>I call on Chevin Fleet Solutions to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Publicly commit to ending all existing contracts with ICE and DHS immigration enforcement</li>
<li>Pledge to refuse all future contracts with these agencies</li>
<li>Issue a public statement addressing this contradiction</li>
</ol>

<p>Until Chevin takes these steps, I will:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Recommend alternatives to organizations considering Chevin]</li>
<li>[Inform Chevin's current customers about this contradiction]</li>
<li>[Share information about this issue with my community]</li>
</ul>

<p>How can Chevin claim to fight trafficking while profiting from traffickers?</p>

<p>I look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
[Your Name]</p>
