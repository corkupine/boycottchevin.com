A website exposing Chevin Fleet Solutions' hypocrisy: claiming to fight human trafficking while profiting from ICE contracts.

## Overview

This website was created by Indivisible Fitchburg MA and supporting organizations to hold Chevin Fleet Solutions accountable for their contradictory policies and ICE contracts totaling $1.6M.

## Key Message

Chevin Fleet Solutions states on their website:
> "We are committed to mitigating the risk of trafficking in persons and forced labour in all aspects of our business."

Yet they provide fleet management services to ICE, an agency with documented evidence of:
- Trafficking operations ("circular transfers")
- Systematic forced labor risks
- Practices that meet the legal definition of human trafficking

## Website Features

- **Statistics**: Key facts about ICE contracts and human rights abuses

- **Chevin's Customers**: List of 100+ organizations using Chevin
- **Take Action**: Practical steps including:
